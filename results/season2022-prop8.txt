=== AFL Germany 2022 ===
Proposal #8 (Fri 7th Jan 2022)
(see summaries by club at the end of this file)

NOTE:
This is the schedule as generated by the aflg-matchplanner tool.

It has one imbalance: Heidelberg women play only three home matches,
whereas the other women teams play four, and the joint team plays five.
This can be easily resolved by moving the women match on match day 7
from Frankfurt to Heidelberg. This would then be the only occasion
where only a women match is played on a ground.

Making this adjustment would bring every women team to 4 home matches,
and there would also still be one match of the joint team played in Frankfurt.

Another note: Travel time for the joint team will always appear much longer than for other teams
because both home and away matches mean travel for most of the players. The provided number of
hours is calculated using the average travel time from all three cities. It will probably be
balanced out as there should be more players available than needed, so that not all players
will be travelling to all matches. They will be more likely to travel to the matches close
to their home, i.e. matches in the north might see a higher share of Kiel players, matches in
the south might see a higher share of Frankfurt and Munich players.

total travel: 564h
